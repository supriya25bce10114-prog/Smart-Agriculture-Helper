# 🌱 Smart Agriculture Helper

## 📝 Description
Smart Agriculture Helper is a Python-based mini-project designed to assist in selecting suitable crops based on environmental conditions such as *soil moisture, **temperature, and **humidity*.  
The system simulates sensor-based smart farming and uses simple decision-making logic to recommend appropriate crop types.  
This project is intended for educational use and demonstrates the basics of smart agriculture and Python programming.
