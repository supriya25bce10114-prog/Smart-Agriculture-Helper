# 1. Problem Statement

Modern agriculture faces several challenges, especially for small and medium-scale farmers who do not have access to continuous monitoring tools. Key environmental factors like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity greatly influence crop health and yield, yet these parameters are rarely tracked effectively.

The problem addressed in this project is the lack of an accessible, simple, and low-cost system that can:

Simulate or collect environmental data

Recommend appropriate crops based on conditions

Provide early detection of potential crop diseases


This project aims to serve as a beginner-friendly digital tool to assist farmers in making better decisions.

# 2. Scope of the Project

This project provides a basic Python-based Smart Agriculture Helper system that performs the following:

Simulates sensor readings (soil moisture, temperature, humidity)

Recommends suitable crops based on environmental thresholds

Randomly detects common crop diseases (simulated)

Displays meaningful results to the farmer


Out of Scope / Future Scope:

Integration with real physical sensors

Machine learning-based disease detection

Cloud-based dashboards or mobile apps

Automated irrigation control hardware

# 3. Target Users

This project is designed for:

Students learning IoT, agriculture tech, or Python

Developers experimenting with smart farming concepts

Farmers seeking a simple digital assistant (after real sensor integration)

Researchers exploring rule-based agriculture systems

# 4. High-Level Features

Sensor Simulation:
Generates realistic environmental readings through Python's random module.

Crop Recommendation System:
Uses threshold-based logic to suggest the best crop—Rice, Wheat, or Maize.

Disease Detection (Simulated):
Randomly predicts crop health (Healthy, Blight, Rust, Powdery Mildew).

Modular Design:
Easily extendable and adaptable for real-world applications.

Lightweight & Portable:
Requires only Python; no external dependencies.
